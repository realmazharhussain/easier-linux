# easier-linux

A project to make usage of the Linux Operating System easier and more comfortable with some extra things.

## How to install?

1. Download and extract the [zip file](https://github.com/realmazharhussain/easier-linux/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) OR clone this repo

2. Go to extracted/cloned folder

3. Open terminal inside the extracted folder

4. Run `sudo ./install.sh` to install everything\
   **OR**\
   Run `sudo ./[component-name]/install.sh` to install just one component\
   e.g. `sudo ./fish/install.sh`

### Arch Linux and Arch-based distros:

Users of  Arch Linux and ArchLinux based distros can run the command `makepkg -i` instead of `sudo ./install.sh` in step 4 in order to install this as an Arch package which can be manipulated (and uninstalled) using pacman and other package-managers/helpers.

## What these files exactly do?

An index of detailed descriptions of all the files included in this repo is available [here](help/index.md)(help/index.md) except for `install.sh`, `uninstall.sh` and `update.sh` files which are self-explanatory.
