# wine SubDirectory

This SubDirectory contains files that make usage of WINE easier

- ### (repo-root)/wine/applications/wine.desktop

  Provides 'Open With' option to open/run .exe files with wine

- ### (repo-root)/wine/autostart/wine.desktop

  Auto-starts/boots wine at log-in. So, when you run your first application/game inside wine after logging-in to your Linux device, it doesn't take a very long time to launch

- ### (repo-root)/wine/icons/hicolor

  A directory that contains wine's icons which are, sometimes, not present in the package provided by the distro
